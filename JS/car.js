// Create a car class. Each car object should have a type(gas, hydrogen, ev, etc), price, mileage, cost, and speed
// The class should also have functions called drive, reverse, and brake.
// drive should increase speed of the object by 5 mph
// stop should set speed to 0,
// reverse should set speed to a negative 2, but can only called when speed is 0
